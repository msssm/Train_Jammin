To setup the source code for your own map, do the following:

Prerequisites: 	You need the toolbox fast marching.
		See in the documentation, in the chapter about path finding.

		Hint: 	There's a bug in compile_mex. You need to delete the
			code lines five and six. And make sure you read the 
			html readme. Then don't forget to switch to the 
			toolbox directory to compile the mexes. 
			And thank me for saving your time ;)

1.	Your map must only contain colorcodes as in loadSituation.m
2.	Write a *.txt file which contains absolute paths in the following order:		- Map
		- Layer1
		- Layer2
		- ...
		- Layer#n
3.	Make your changes to customGroups.m.
4.	Change the first few variables in Setup.m.
5.	You should be good to go.
