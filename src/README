To setup the source code for your own map, do the following:

1.	Your map must only contain colorcodes as in loadSituation.m
2.	Write a *.txt file which contains absolute paths in the following order:		- Map
		- Layer1
		- Layer2
		- ...
		- Layer#n
3.	Make your changes to customGroups.m.
4.	Change the first few variables in Setup.m.
5.	You should be good to go.
